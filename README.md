This project aims to a Simple Banking Application in Java.
It covers fundamental concepts like the Scanner class for input, strings, loops, methods,
and conditional statements. This project involves basic
banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals,
checking balances, and exiting the program.
Using the Java Scanner classaims to parse text for strings and primitive types using a regular expression. It is the simplest way to get input in Java. 
By the help of Scanner in Java, we can get input from the user in primitive types such as int, long, double, byte, float, short, etc.
Scanner class in Java is found in the java.util package.
Also Switch Case is used in this code for the user to choose independently about deposits, withdraws, checking balance or exiting the program. 
It eases the way of writing and also enhances the styling of the program.
